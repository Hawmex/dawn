## üìå Why Dawn Exists

- I really like Flutter's approach (`StatelessWidget`, `StatefulWidget`, `State`, etc.),
  but I didn't find it easy at all to develop custom UIs in Flutter compared to
  HTML and CSS. See [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/97496).
- Flutter web is great but it hugely suffers from initial loading performance.

I decided to make something that has the best of both worlds.
The ease of developing custom UIs quickly with the elegant approach of Flutter,
without compromising the performance.
